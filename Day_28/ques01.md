### Question-01

You are tasked with creating a simple vehicle system in C++ using object-oriented programming principles.
Implement a base class Vehicle and two derived classes Car and Bike. Each vehicle can perform certain common actions, but they also have specific attributes and methods.

**Requirements**:

- ##### Base Class: Vehicle
  - Attributes:
    - `string make`: The manufacturer of the vehicle.
    - `int year`: The year the vehicle was manufactured.
    - `float fuel`: The amount of fuel left in the vehicle.
  - Methods:
    - `void refuel(float amount)`: Increases the fuel by amount.
    - `void display()`: A virtual method that displays the vehicle's details.
    - `Derived Class`: Car (inherits from Vehicle)
  - Attributes:
    - `int doors`: Number of doors in the car.
  - Methods:
    - `void display()`: Override the display() method to show car-specific details, including the number of doors.
    - `void openDoors()`: A method that prints "Doors are opened."
- ##### Derived Class: Bike (inherits from Vehicle)
  - Attributes:
    - `bool hasCarrier`: Indicates whether the bike has a carrier.
  - Methods:
    - `void display()`: Override the `display()` method to show bike-specific details, including whether it has a carrier.
    - `void kickStart()`: A method that prints "Bike kick-started."
- ##### Main Functionality:
  Create objects of Car and Bike with relevant attributes.
  Refuel both vehicles and display their details.
  Call their specific methods (`openDoors()` for Car and `kickStart()` for Bike).
